        Born in Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein is one of the most celebrated scientists of the Twentieth Century. His theories on relativity laid the framework for a new branch of physics, and Einstein’s E = mc2 on mass-energy equivalence is one of the most famous formulas in the world. In 1921, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for his contributions to theoretical physics and the evolution of Quantum Theory.Born in Germany in 1879, Albert Einstein is one of the most celebrated scientists of the Twentieth Century.

        Einstein is also well known as an original free-thinker, speaking on a range of humanitarian and global issues. After contributing to the theoretical development of nuclear physics and encouraging F.D. Roosevelt to start the Manhattan Project, he later spoke out against the use of nuclear weapons.
        
        Born in Germany to Jewish parents, Einstein settled in Switzerland and then, after Hitler’s rise to power, the United States. Einstein was a truly global man and one of the undisputed genius’ of the Twentieth Century.

        <h3>Quantum Theory</h3>

Einstein suggested that light doesn’t just travel as waves but as electric currents. This photoelectric effect could force metals to release a tiny stream of particles known as ‘quanta’. From this Quantum Theory, other inventors were able to develop devices such as television and movies. He was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1921.

<h3>Special Theory of Relativity</h3>

This theory was written in a simple style with no footnotes or academic references. The core of his theory of relativity is that:

“Movement can only be detected and measured as relative movement; the change of position of one body in respect to another.”

    <h3>1. Theory of Special Relativity (1905)</h3>
    <p>In his 1905 paper, “On the Electrodynamics of Moving Bodies,” Einstein introduced the special theory of relativity. This theory revolutionized our understanding of space and time by proposing that the laws of physics are the same for all observers in uniform motion.</p>
    <h3>2. Photoelectric Effect (1905)</h3>
    <p> the same year as his special theory of relativity, Einstein published another groundbreaking paper on the photoelectric effect. This phenomenon occurs when light, typically in the form of photons, strikes a material surface and liberates electrons from it.</p>
